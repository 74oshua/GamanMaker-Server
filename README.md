# GamanMaker-Server

This is the serverside component of GamanMaker

## What is GamanMaker?
GamanMaker is a Valheim mod that adds a few server commands to the game, availible only to the server admins.

### List of new/modified commands:
weather list - Lists all envnames availible to use with "weather set"

weather set [envname] - Sets the current weather for every player on the server

invis [on|off] - Makes the caller's player invisible to every player on the server

tod [float] - Exactly like the vanilla tod command, except that it's enabled for use on a server
